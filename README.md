# cm7-lang-parser

Cm7 is a language to represent chords and lyrics. This package is a parser for this language. See [here](docs/spec.md) for the language specification.

## Motivation
Displaying chords on top of each line of lyrics at the correct position can be tricky. The idea is to write the chords and lyrics in a way regardless of the correct position. Then the parser transform it into JSON containing useful info for the frontend to decide how to show it.

## Usage
